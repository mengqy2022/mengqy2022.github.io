## Minor role

Hello everyone! My name is Mengqingyao.

In order to improve my English skills, I wish I could fill in the content in English as well.

Thanks to Github and Jekyll was a quick way for me to set up this site, not a very difficult thing to do, but it must have been cool to stick with it.

I'll fill in as much content as I like pretty much at random.
